week 10/16:
notes
  need to find motor that works, is gonna weigh more than anticipated and more than the high level requirement originally specified. 
  spent time ordering parts for the circuit. force sensing resistor values calculated to make sure it could handle  amount of pressure we want accurately and ordered correct model.


week 11/1:
notes
  need to add circuit for programming esp32 to pcb. look up how to make it and look at the schematics for the dev board. cp210 programmer. Place an order for these and spare parts. Take wires from the breadboard and connect them from the pcb to test that way.
